  <h1>Waters Corporation – A Quiet Giant in Life Sciences</h1>
  <p><em>Posted: July 24, 2025</em></p>

  <p><strong>Ticker:</strong> WAT | <strong>Sector:</strong> Healthcare | <strong>Industry:</strong> Life Sciences Tools & Services</p>

  <h2>💡 Thesis</h2>
  <p>Waters Corporation is a dominant player in the analytical instruments market, providing essential tools for pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and industrial labs. Its razor–razorblade business model—high-margin instrument sales followed by recurring consumables and services—makes it a compounder in disguise.</p>

  <h2>📊 Financial Highlights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Revenue: ~$3.6B (FY2024)</li>
    <li>Gross Margin: ~57%</li>
    <li>Free Cash Flow Margin: ~25%</li>
    <li>ROIC: consistently above 30%</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🌍 Market Position & Moat</h2>
  <p>Waters operates in a highly concentrated space with few global competitors (e.g., Thermo Fisher, Agilent). It has deep customer entrenchment due to complex instrument calibration, regulatory approval cycles, and decades-long relationships.</p>

  <h2>📈 Risks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Capital expenditure cycles of biopharma clients</li>
    <li>High exposure to China ( >25% revenue)</li>
    <li>Innovation pressure from lower-cost competitors</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🏁 Verdict</h2>
  <p>While not a hyper-growth name, Waters offers durable margins, sticky revenue, and a fortress balance sheet. Worth watching for long-term compounders in life sciences infrastructure.</p>
